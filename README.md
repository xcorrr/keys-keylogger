# keys-keylogger
A JS batched keylogger that saves keys to a webhook.  `NOTE:` For **educational purposes only**. I **do not** condone to **any malicious activity using this tool**.
```Replace "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE" with your real discord webhook url.```
`NOTE:` this is a **basic keylogger**. it does not grab keys from the browser UI.
